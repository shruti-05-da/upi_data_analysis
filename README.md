# UPI DATA DASHBOARD
This project focuses on analyzing Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transaction data for popular apps and participating banks in India. The goal was to identify usage patterns, transaction volumes, values, and growth trends to understand the digital payments landscape.

The dataset—sourced from public transaction statistics—was messy and unstructured, requiring thorough data cleaning before analysis. The project used a combination of Excel, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy), and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights.

# OBJECTIVES

>> Clean and preprocess raw datasets containing UPI transaction statistics for apps and banks.

>> Identify top-performing UPI apps and leading banks by transaction volume and value.

>> Detect seasonal patterns, month-on-month growth, and transaction distribution.

>> Build interactive dashboards to visualize KPIs.

>> Derive insights to support strategic decision-making in the fintech space.
